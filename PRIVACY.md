# Privacy Policy for Portal Sekolah Quiz Builder

**Last Updated:** January 10, 2026

## 1. Data Collection
Portal Sekolah Quiz Builder ("the Add-on") is an installable Google Apps Script Add-on. 
- The Add-on processes the content of the Google Document where it is activated to extract quiz questions ("Question Blocks") and images.
- This processing happens entirely within the Google Apps Script environment attached to your account.
- We do **not** collect, store, or transmit your document content to any third-party servers.

## 2. Data Usage
- **Images:** Extracted images are temporarily processed to generate the ZIP export. They are not stored permanently by the Add-on.
- **Exported Data:** The final JSON and ZIP files are downloaded directly to your local device.

## 3. User Data
The Add-on requires access to your Google Drive and Google Docs to:
1.  Read the active document (to parse questions).
2.  Display the user interface (Sidebar).
3.  Generate the export file.

We do not track user identity or usage analytics.
